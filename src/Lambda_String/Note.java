    The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface.
    It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing
     the implementation.
     A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
     Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented
     right in the body of a method.

     functional programming is called lambda. To type codes in functional programming is shorter and it is error free.
     In functional programming, we use the methods that were created by Java.
     The usage of structured programing is a longer way to type codes in Java.
     For ex; substring() is created by Java it is error free bec it was created by Java which means that it was tested
     thousands of times before it was deployed. Functioanl programming can be used for arrays, collections and maps
     but we cannot use maps directly in functional programmine directly. At the beginnig we should convert a map to a
     collection and then we can use maps for functional programming as weel ==>How to convert a map into a collection??

      by using entryset() we can convert a map into a set and set is collection then you can use Collections in functional programming.

      1) Lambda is functional programming, IT field started to use Lambda in Java 8.
      2) In Functional Programming we focus on "what to do?" but in Structured Programming Language we focus on "how to do?"
      3) Functional Programming can be used just with Arrays and Collections
      4) By using "entrySet()" method java converts MAp to Set then you can Functional Programming in Maps as well.
  public interface IntStream extends BaseStream<Integer, 
   IntStream> A sequence of primitive int-valued elements supporting sequential 
   and parallel aggregate operations . 
    This is the int primitive specialization of Stream.

    What is the difference between stream and IntStream?
Stream<Integer> operates on boxed values ​​
(Integer instead of primitive int) which takes significantly 
      more memory and usually a lot of boxing/unboxing operations 
(depending on your code), whereas IntStream works with primitives
